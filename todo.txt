1) ultrametric distances from mst
2) upgma to create newick represented tree
3) robinson foulds (built into ete2 - must be in newiick format) + tree visualizaion(ete2 package)
4) Identifying features/getting data for 
	distance
	proximity to airport
	population density
	health system status
	value of economic trade
	amount of people that move betweentwo places
	cultrual proximity
	trade
	density of air/road links
5) turn features into distance metric
6) train features
7) more distance metrics for sequences (things with cnv?)
8) regression random forest for learning?
9) analysis
